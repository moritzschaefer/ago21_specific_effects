# Data

The scripts depend on the supplementary tables provided with the publication. Copy them into data/ for the scripts to find them.

Some files used in these scripts have been generated by snakePipes' index-generation. I included for example genes.bed into the data/ folder, but you can create it on your own (see pipelines/index-generation). Running index-generation is also required for running the other pipelines (see pipelines/ folder). 

# Run

You can create a conda environment using the conda.yaml file: `conda env create -f conda.yaml`

Also, we use pyensembl for some things, so make sure to run: `pyensembl install --release 98 --species mouse`

You might need to run `git submodule init && git submodule update` if you want to run diffTF

To reproduce the figures from the publication, go into the appropriate figure folders and run the scripts (using `python` or `Rscript`). They are named according to the plots they create.

Note: The Ago2&1_KO mutant is annotated as 'ago12' in most of the code
