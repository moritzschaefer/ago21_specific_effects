# Data

The scripts depend on the supplementary tables provided with the publication. Copy them into data/ for the scripts to find them.

You also need a genes.bed file containing coordinates for all transcripts. The file is generated by snakePipes' index-generation and should be placed in the data directory (i.e. the project directory).

To run diffTF, you need additional files generated by the snakePipes index-generation

# Run

You can create a conda environment using the conda.yaml file: `conda env create -f conda.yaml`

Also, we use pyensembl for some things, so make sure to run: `pyensembl install --release 98 --species mouse`

You might need to run `git submodule init && git submodule update`

To reproduce the figures from the publication, go into the appropriate figure folders and run the scripts. They are named according to the plots they create.

Note: The Ago2&1_KO mutant is annotated as 'ago12' in the code
